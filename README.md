# dotFiles

This repository contains various dotfiles and configuration files that I use on my local machine.

## Usage

To use these dotfiles, clone this repository to your local machine and then symlink the files to their corresponding locations. For example, to symlink the `.vimrc` file, you would run:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/dotFiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Be careful when symlinking files, as you could accidentally overwrite existing configuration files.
